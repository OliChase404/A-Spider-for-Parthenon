I&#39;d climb up and walk right through those wooden-framed photographs
I&#39;d start cryin&#39; and hug my dad

Now all I have is dog tags, pilot maps, your faded name at Trinidad, Polaroids, hand-me-downs
Every beautiful soul is lost and found
Planted in your name
I&#39;d like to think a kid&#39;s swingin&#39; from a branch someday

You cut your bangs too short on the first day
Then six years from then we watched you walk on that stage and if dad was there he&#39;d smile and tell you you&#39;re brave

You&#39;re A.D.D. when you scan the radio
Oh you took me and showed me the classics
The NeverEnding Story and Willow
Played Nintendo to Mr. Bombastic
Just a teen when you made the choice Nicole
See the shine of impeccable timing
Most run away but you stayed and broke the mold
See the shine of that silver lining

Bottled it up and let it all out after the hospital on a red couch
Feeling down 
Mom said &quot;It&#39;ll be fine&quot;
When you break through the clouds sister, there will be sunshine


You&#39;re A.D.D. when you scan the radio
Oh you took me and showed me the classics
The NeverEnding Story and Willow
Played Nintendo to Mr. Bombastic
Just a teen when you made the choice Nicole
See the shine of impeccable timing
Most run away but you stayed and broke the mold
See the shine of that silver lining

See that silver sparkling
See that silver sparkling
She&#39;s the silver lining

You&#39;re A.D.D. when you scan the radio

He saved nothing for the way back

Mendocino &#39;98
We were crying on a jagged cliff that day 
I said, &quot;If I die before I wake will you toss me in the violent sea instead?&quot;

We always lived on the coast
It was June when you died out there, trying to save some strangers
I don&#39;t ever feel alone
I always feel your presence here, your true beautiful soul

Mendocino &#39;98
We were crying on a jagged cliff that day 
I said, &quot;If I die before I wake will you toss me in the violent sea instead?&quot;

Deep inside me swell is turning
I am hearing sound
Is this feeling
You and me now moving with the tide

To be there where you are

Mendocino &#39;98
We were crying on a jagged cliff that day 
I said, &quot;If I die before I wake will you toss me in the violent sea instead?&quot;</div>

We shook the snow out of our sleeves in the powder
You and me were the first to arrive, the last to leave
Wedding white and emerald green in the cold air

When I see your face, will I be older than you?

On the chairlift we sat and watched the trees go by
After the snowdrift&#39;s lullaby there&#39;s silence on the catenary
You and I in a Trooper on the mountainside
We had to stop there for the night, I remember
Sometimes I worry that heaven is just in our minds, a lie to keep our hearts from dying, I hope it&#39;s real 
&#39;Cause I wanna see you like an artist who&#39;s lost his eyes
I&#39;m longing for you like a bird who&#39;s kept inside

When I see your face, will I be older than you?
When I see your face, will I be older than you?
When I leave this place

Marsh and pastel blue
I&#39;ll cross the bridge with you

When I see your face, will I be older than you?
When I see your face, will I be older than you?
When I leave this place, will I be older than you?

I&#39;ve learned from trial and error
We&#39;re all collateral and all that&#39;s matter is all that matters

Saintes nouvelles en gondole
Passent devant les favélas dorées

He&#39;s a Chinese lantern
She&#39;s the center of a Russian doll
He&#39;ll never know her and his ink ran on his epilogue 

Hollowed novels
Homes on water from the outside
Gold favela
A glimpse, a speck, a fleeting flake that drifted by like ticker tape
A flash and then just spiraling fumes
Kaleidoscope, you broke in two

Saintes nouvelles en gondole
Passent devant les favélas dorées
Qui disparaissent en spiralant
Kaleidoscope était ton nom

À mon réveil
La gorge desséchée
Et les souvenirs du rêve

J&#39;étais rentrée
Rentrée dans la poitrine d&#39;un étranger
Et oui, c&#39;était toi, l&#39;étranger
Des vaisseaux et ton cœur 

Finalement je sus arrivée au vaisseau central
Et c&#39;était comme un ascenseur 
Je suis montée dedans
Et j&#39;ai vu en bas
Tout en bas
La lumière</div>

                    <div>Spirit and soul covered in it like rocker box gold
The shell is still damaged and takes its toll 
And every morning I wake up I&#39;m not the same as I was before and no one knows what&#39;s wrong or what&#39;s behind those doors

You&#39;re speaking to a glass half full and I&#39;m alright
It&#39;s just the sword in the bull that struck the wire but missed the spool 

Pins and needles
I ran aground
Please don&#39;t beat a dead horse
Please don&#39;t run a man down
If I seem like I&#39;m fading don&#39;t worry &#39;bout me
Really I&#39;m lucky to be here, to feel the pebbles glide under my toes
The ebb and flow
We all bleed when we pluck the rose

You&#39;re speaking to a glass half full and I&#39;m alright
It&#39;s just the sword in the bull that struck the wire but missed the spool 
And every sunrise is a marmalade fugue
You&#39;re speaking to a glass half full

Håller upp mot ljuset
